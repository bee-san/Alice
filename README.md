# What is Alice?
Alice is a (software) friend designed to help you create better blog posts.

Alice is what I use personally on [skerritt.blog](skerritt.blog) to write better posts.

# What can Alice do?
At the moment, not much.
I have a (private) issues tracker / roadmap :smile:

At the moment, Alice can:
* Automatically inserts [UTM tags](https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/campaign-url-builder/) to all links
When you use analytics software, you often get flucuations in views. Let's say you get 200 views in one hour. With UTM, they'll know those views came from me. Without UTM, they'll just see "email". The idea is hopefully it'll get me noticed to a lot of other people. Kinda like a marketting channel.
* Double checks to make sure all links are ok and non 404
* Auto caps title links
* Asks you if you want to caps a link. So inline links are only effected if you choose them to be
* Automatically adds space between emoji and the first word
* removes full stops from links

Of course, this is a work in progress.
